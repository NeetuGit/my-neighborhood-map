# My Neighborhood Map
This app provides a listing of nearby places in Parramatta, NSW, Australia.   The project was built for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.

The map is generated by the Google Maps API.  The list of places is generated by a call to the Foursquare API Search endpoint. A second API request is made when a location is clicked to get details about the places, including address and name. A link to the places's Foursquare page is provided for more information.

## How to Load the App in Development Mode

The project uses Node.js. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app
```
git clone https://github.com/NeetuGit/my-neighborhood-map.git
npm install
```
Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with
```
npm start
```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
